The dataset used by FFVM contains MIDI files and pre-processed npy files

MIDI files are mainly piano versions of popular music.

The main melody is extracted, noise removal is carried out, and stored as npy file.

notes_data.npy is processed from the entire dataset, while notes_data_flat.npy is processed from melodies with little change in pitch in the dataset.
